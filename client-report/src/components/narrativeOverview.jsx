          <strong>Pol.is' New Narrative Report</strong>
        </p>
        <p style={globals.paragraph}>
          You're seeing a beta version of Polis' new narrative report—generated with the help of
          Large Language Models (LLMs). We are currently crowdsourcing evaluations of this report
          with the help of our user community—people like you! Thank you for participating in these
          early evaluations.
        </p>
        <p style={globals.paragraph}>
          This report has been designed to address a critical bottleneck in Polis conversations:
          human facilitators spend countless hours turning Polis results into accessible reports for
          both participants and decision-makers. Our first goal is to substantially augment human
          report writing, getting any user most of the way to an acceptable deliverable report in a
          fraction of the time it would a professional data scientist manually.
        </p>
        <p style={globals.paragraph}>
          Large language models can make big mistakes. Detailed human review is absolutely critical,
          even if almost all clauses are accurate. We aim to improve both quality and speed through
          ongoing iteration.
        </p>

          <strong>Generating a Polis Narrative Report</strong>
        </p>
        <p style={globals.paragraph}>
          You can currently choose between Gemini and Claude, with many more options coming soon.
          You can use the same link to access the report throughout the conversation. A new
          intermediary report is recomputed every hour, and a final report will be generated once
          the conversation is closed. To keep a record of intermediary reports, please save them as
          PDFs using print to PDF.
        </p>
        <p style={globals.paragraph}>
          We advise against sharing intermediary narrative reports with the broader public, as it
          can change significantly throughout the conversation and may contain errors. Once the
          conversation is complete, you can review the final report and share it as is or create a
          custom version for wider distribution.
        </p>
        <p style={globals.secondaryHeading}>
          <strong>Reviewing the Final Narrative Report</strong>
        </p>
        <p style={globals.paragraph}>
          The report will very likely contain errors. Each clause in the report should be
          accompanied by citations, drawn from statements submitted by participants. Please review
          each clause against the cited statements and flag the following:
          <ol>
            <li>Clauses that misrepresent the cited statements</li>
            <li>Statistical or numeric issues with the summary</li>
            <li>Redundant clauses that are not helpful</li>
            <li>Clauses that do not have accompanying citations</li>
          </ol>
          For quality control purposes, you will not be able to add new clauses to the Polis
          narrative report. We welcome your feedback on the report, and will use it to improve the
          report generation process.
