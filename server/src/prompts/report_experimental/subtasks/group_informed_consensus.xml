    <criticalInstructions>
        <instruction>
            Generate a JSON response that conforms to the provided schema. DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OTHER
            TEXT.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            Analyze and include ALL comments that show consensus patterns â€” the data is already
            filtered for those with the requisite score threshold for group-aware consensus.
            The analysis should be exhaustive and comprehensive, potentially spanning many
            paragraphs.
            Each consensus pattern should be supported by multiple comment citations.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            Group related comments into coherent themes, but ensure every relevant comment is cited
            at least once.
            Aim for 100% coverage of consensus comments in the dataset.

                    this is a tl;dr paragraph for the entire consensus in the conversation. it is
                    the most critical paragraph of the entire report since group informed consensus
                    is the most valuable aspect of the data. It should be a high-level overview of
                    the consensus patterns in the conversation. It will be followed by a more
                    detailed analysis of each theme. It requires citations for every clause.
